1.How is the logged in user being kept track of?

logging in and out is working by flask_bcrypt and 
session storage. there  is authenticate function 
which is check password with user.

2.What is Flaskâ€™s g object?

g now lives in the application context.

Every request pushes a new application 
context, wiping the old one, so g can still 
be used to set flags per-request without change to code.
The application context is popped after teardown_request 
is called. (Armin's presentation explains this is 
because things like creating DB connections are tasks
 which setup the environment for the request, 
 and should not be handled inside before_request 
 and after_request)

 3.What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?

  user is making flask global through  putting 'g'.

  4.What does @app.before_request mean?

  The before_request decorator allows us to 
  execute a function before any request.
